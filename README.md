Lack of parent-of-origin effects in Nasonia jewel wasp - a replication and reproduction study

Parent and species of origin allele specific and differential expression analysis workflow. A replication and reproduction study using RNA and DNA from Nasonia jewel wasp a haplodiploidy species. In diploid cells, the paternal and maternal alleles are on average equally expressed. There are exceptions from this is which a small number of genes express exclusively the maternal or paternal allele copy,  known as genomic imprinting. Clark et al. 2016 found no parent-of-origin effects in the hybrids of closely related Nasonia vitripennis and N. giuralti jewel wasp, suggesting a lack of epigenetic reprogramming during embryogenesis in these species. Here, we have reproduced and replicated these findings using the previously published RNA & DNA sequence data from 11 samples as well as a newly generated RNA data from 12 samplesof the same species hybrids. Our results from both datasets demonstrated a species-of-origin effect.
